# Self assembly from DIY kit
Step 1:

Open the package and get the case, and the E-inc hat from the package.

Step 2:

Open the printed case and put the e-inc screen on the table infront of you like shown in the picture.

Step 3:

Then start putting the screen in carefully the top left corner first so you dont break the screen ribbon.

Step 4:

You can use a spatula or some tool to help softly push the screen in. Dont use too much force tho.

Step 5:

When you get it in you should then have the screen at the angle like in the image and after that just push it down from the corners, so its fully in.

Step 6:

Then take your soldered rasperry pi and line it up so its correct way.

Step 7:

Start alligning the pins from the left side to get the rasperry in correctly.

Step 8:

You can use a tool here as well to try flex the case a bit but be carefull with the sd card connector on rasperry pi to not flex or damage that.

Step 9:

And now when the rasperry is in the case you can just push it down from the corners next to the pins. You can use little bit force at this point if its alligned up correctly. And you know its deep enough when the board is flush with the case edge.

And then your done. Hopefully you didnt break anything! :DDD
